                    data engineering to drive important insights. 
                    I am an advocate and an adept user on 
                    using technology for social good, analyzing data
                    to find solutions that have a symbiotic 
                    relationship between businesses and communities.</p></td>

                <td class = 'left-cell'>My Experience <br> <br><p>I have active experience in Python, SQL, and R, 
                    working on various data-driven projects. With 1.5 
                    years in a Help Desk role, I developed strong problem 
                    solving skills, and I currently preprocess data for 
                    graduate students using Excel. I also placed second 
                    in a hackathon and had the opportunity to 
                    present at the governor’s residence in Pennsylvania. 
                    As a Data Jam mentor, I guide community college and 
                    high school students through data analysis projects, 
                    helping build their technical, analytical, 
                    and collaboration skills.</p></td>
