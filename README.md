My Official Portfolio Website!

# Background
- This is my first full HTML/CSS/JS Project.
- Frontend isn't my main domain, and as this is my first project, the code is extremely sloppy. 
- I hope to build more frontend projects in my freetime eventually and get more used to the box model.

# Design
- I designed my website using Figma
- I used portfolios I found online for inspiration, and created a visual moodboard of what looked visually appealing to me.
- I made a low-fidelity model to show how I wanted to format my site.
- I created a high-fidelity model based on my site.
- I presented my completed website to my professor and received feedback to iterate on my design.
